An overview of the intended application and WHY we feel it’s valuable

It is estimated that over 80 billion pounds of food are thrown away every year in the US.  On the other hand, due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 50 million people may experience food insecurity in the US, including a potential 17 million children.  If we could somehow transfer that waste to those who are food insecure, that would result in 1,600 pounds of food per person for a year (almost 5 lbs of food per day).  This disconnect reflects a need for better food management systems, which will reduce food waste and unnecessary food shortages or starvation, stabilize food prices, optimize the food-on-hand, and increase dietary awareness.  It all starts by managing what is in your own refrigerator.  Done on a mass scale, we have the power to reduce food waste to new lows, feed more people with the same or less amount of food, and save the environment from unnecessary contamination and destruction.

Pseudocode/User Story

User has ability to enter, edit, view, and delete food items in virtual fridge
Each item has name, quantity, expiration date inputs
Items are sorted by the soonest expiration date
Trigger function(s) based on when items expire the soonest
Possible functions to trigger:
	-Send alert when an item is about to expire (24 hours? User set?)
	-Connect to API for item’s nutritional data 
-Connect to API for recipe suggestions based on items in fridge, with notifications to user of missing items based on recipe suggestions

60 Second Elevator Pitch
Have you ever gone to your refrigerator and found food that you had forgotten about, but has already expired?  Did you wish you had an app to remind you what food is about to expire, so you don’t ever waste any food?  Would you also want some recipe suggestions and nutritional information based on the food you have, with notifications for what ingredients you might be missing to complete a recipe?  Well, we have the app for you!  Food Saver will save you food, time, and money as it makes sure no food goes to waste, recipe suggestions are plentiful, and nutritional mindfulness is increased.  Never throw away food again!  Discover new recipes!  Become more mindful of your dietary intake!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
